In fact, this hassle-free\n                          process of proving makes the NFTs an ideal digital\n                          collectible investment.\n                        </>\n                      }\n                      show={false}\n                    />\n                    <Accordian\n                      head={\"Why should I even invest in NFTs?\"}\n                      body={\n                        <>\n                          {\" \"}\n                          NFTs represent collectibles in the digital space.\n                          Investing in collectibles with provable lineage and\n                          value is never a bad idea. It is to be noted that\n                          collectibles might be subjective in their value. Some\n                          NFT collectibles have grown by over 100x of their\n                          original value over a period of just days.\n                        </>\n                      }\n                      show={false}\n                    />\n                    <Accordian\n                      head={\n                        \"Considering crypto’s legal stance, will my NFT’s value dilute at any time?\"\n                      }\n                      body={\n                        <>\n                          While ‘cryptocurrency’ might have its share of legal\n                          uncertainty, the technology behind NFTs does not have\n                          such hassles. A lot of jurisdictions are catching up\n                          to accommodate this new dependable technology,\n                          considering them as legally valid proofs and pieces of\n                          evidence. Therefore, your NFT will always hold its\n                          value. It is also to be remembered that the NFT is\n                          inherently valuable and the technology only serves as\n                          a tool to prove its authenticity and keep a record of\n                          the NFT transactions.\n                        </>\n                      }\n                      show={false}\n                    />\n                    <Accordian\n                      head={\n                        \"What determines the value of an NFT art, music or video?\"\n                      }\n                      body={\n                        <>\n                          The value of any NFT, as much as it is for any\n                          collectible, is subjective and it might not be\n                          possible to fit it into an equation. However, certain\n                          factors like the rarity of the NFT, the person\n                          launching it, the asset/collectible it represents, and\n                          the profile of people owning other similar NFTs are\n                          known to increase the value.\n                        </>\n                      }\n                      show={false}\n                    />\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6\">\n                    <Accordian\n                      head={\"How do I purchase an NFT?\"}\n                      body={\n                        <>\n                          {\" \"}\n                          <p>\n                            Now you can buy NFT with both USDT and fiat\n                            currency.
