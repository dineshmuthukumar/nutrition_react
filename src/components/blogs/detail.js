                <p>Meta Cricket League NFT Collection</p>
                <p>
                  On 22nd April’22, Jump.trade, as its initial launch, dropped
                  the World’s First Cricket Game NFT Collection. Creating a
                  record of 55,000 NFTs getting sold in just nine minutes,
                  amounting to about 0.009 seconds for every NFT being sold,
                  making this one of the fastest and the most prolific NFT drops
                  ever in the history of gaming and NFTs.
                </p>
                <p>What is the collection about</p>
                <p>
                  The NFT drop was a combination of cricket players’ NFT avatars
                  and exclusive cricket bat NFTs. The cricket bats are
                  authenticated and signed by some of the legendary cricketers
                  from India and prominent cricket names across the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The collections, going with the GuardianLink legacy, were
                  bundled in a blind purchase called the Super LootBox.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the major USP of the NFT collection was the series of
                  signed cricket bat NFTs in 3-D. These 3-D NFTs featured signed
                  bats of the World Cup-winning team of 1983, both the finalists
                  of the World Cup of 2003, and the victorious team of the 2011
                  World Cup. Considering how prized these NFTs were, they were
                  put up on auctions starting at $25 per collection. Every
                  collection had three NFTs ( one signed bat NFT, and two player
                  NFTs.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  These signed bats would not only be highly collectible and
                  unique but would also have a lot of value in the gameplay as a
                  part of the roadmap that follows Meta Cricket League, P2E game
                  in Q2 ’22.
                </p>
                <p>The classification:</p>
                <p>
                  NFTs would not have varying degrees of demand and rarity if
                  not for their classification, and the NFTs dropped on
                  Jump.trade for the game Meta Cricket League also complied with
                  this industry standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The players were classified as rookie, rare, epic,legendary.
                  These classification categories apply to both bowlers and
                  batsmen. The bats, depending on the player who has endorsed
                  them, were classified as rare, super rare, ultra-rare, and
                  immortal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This unique game of NFT cricket combined the prowess of the
                  player, the capacity of the bats, and the skill of the user,
                  making it an exclusive cricket game where users can use any
                  combination to upgrade their playing capacity.
                </p>
                <p>Pre-booking and its outcomes :</p>
                <p>
                  To encourage our collectors and the community, a way to
                  enhance the drive of our enthusiasts, we opened a pre-booking
                  option for the first time ever in the history of GuardianLink
                  NFTs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pre-booking met with an overwhelming response receiving
                  more than 200% of requests. Not for the NFTs earmarked for pre
                  booking but for the entire NFT collection volume!
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 20th Apr ’22, we revealed that 52,172 Super Loot NFTs have
                  been pre-booked which is literally double the count of the
                  entire NFT collection in the drop. In the interest of the open
                  sale, we had to block only 16,000 Super Loot NFTs in the
                  pre-booking allocation, presenting 9000 Super Loot NFTs for
                  the drop on 22nd Apr’22 (5:00 PM IST), for public sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  About 9000 NFTs were set aside for the day of the actual rock
                  and based on a specified priority, NFT collections were
                  allotted to people who pre-booked the NFTs.
                </p>
                <p>The Drop day – 22nd Apr’22</p>
                <p>
                  As scheduled, the auctions opened at 4:00 PM on 22nd Apr ’22,
                  and the collection immediately saw a 1000% increase in the bid
                  price from the base price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Super Loot opened at 5:00 PM on the same day, and in
                  addition to the pre-booking, a total of 55,000 NFTs spread
                  across 25,000 Super Loot packages were sold in less than nine
                  minutes. That makes it about one NFT sold every 0.009 seconds.
                  One of the fastest-selling NFT drops ever!
                </p>
                <p>The Treasure Box</p>
                <p>
                  If all of this wasn’t rewarding enough, GuardianLink, going
                  with its legacy of rewarding the community, brought the
                  Treasure Box again!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Treasure Box not only included the current allocation of
                  $50,000 but also included the remnants from the last Treasure
                  Box, making the total value of the Treasure Box about $52,998.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every five NFTs would unlock a Treasure Box. This meant that
                  the more NFTs you hold, the more were your chances of winning
                  prizes. The best part about the Treasure Box is that it was
                  not left to probability. Every Treasure Box contains at least
                  some reward or the other! The box was a true treasure in every
                  sense, as it unlocked cryptos, some with highest value too.
                </p>
                <p>The finishing strike</p>
                <p>
                  GuardianLink, through Jump.trade, is bringing you the world’s
                  first-ever cricket NFT game, and the overwhelming response and
                  astounding statistics have shown that the game will be
                  welcomed.
