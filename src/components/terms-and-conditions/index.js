                    restrictions and limits might also be the result of your
                    agreement with the third-party payment service provider or

                    Any activity on the blockchain including but not limited to
                    transactions may require payments of small fees called ‘gas’

                    The Digital Collectibles are available either for direct
                    purchase or under a pre-booking system or under an auction
                    system or under a limit order system. The purchase of the
                    Digital Collectible at an advertised list price will reduce
                    your spending balance permanently by a commensurate number
                    of tokens.

                  <p>
                    The platform follows the classic English auction method. The
                    auction is bound by a certain stretch of time. The platform
                    will list the Digital Collectible and will decide on the
                    minimum bid value.

                  <p>
                    The user with the highest bid at the time of the auction
                    ending is considered the winner of the auction and they,
                    upon conditions required being met, will be eligible to own
                    the Digital Collectible.

                    If a bid is placed within the last 10 minutes of the
                    auction, the auction time will be extended by 10 minutes
                    from the time of the bid, so last minute bids can be
                    accommodated.{" "}

                    Non-Fungible tokens can be sold either through direct
                    selling or by opening a bidding process on the marketplace.
                    Whether or not the non-fungible token will be sold through
                    bidding depends on the nature of the token and the

                  <p>
                    Unlike the classic auction, the bidding on the marketplace
                    is not time-bound. The seller reserves the right to close
                    the auction at any point in time they deem suitable. The
                    seller understands that only a certain type of nonfungible

                    In the event of the seller not acknowledging a bid placed on
                    the non-fungible token, the locked amount for the bidder
                    will automatically be released and the bid placed will be
                    considered lapsed. The platform does not hold responsibility

                    When a seller lists an NFT for direct sale/bidding, it is
                    the responsibility of the seller to ensure that the listing

                    Blockchain is a nascent technology and there are
                    possibilities of technological difficulties. In the event of
                    such difficulties being experienced, the Platform may not
                    function at its intended capacity and it might affect the
                    access to your Collectibles.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Blockchain technology is subject to multiple legal
                    uncertainties, and there are possibilities of the Platform,
                    the Collectibles, and your funds being adversely impacted in
                    case of any regulatory and legal inquiries, investigations,
                    claims, fines, judgments, suits, and actions. This could
                    hamper or impede your ability to continue the use of our
                    Platform, the associated assets, and every other
                    manifestation of this technology. By agreeing to these
                    terms, you accept that you understand these uncertainties
                    and risks.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Transactions involving the purchase of Collectibles may not
                    be reversible except for the instances described in our
                    refund policy. Any losses that occur due to fraudulent or
                    accidental transactions will not be recoverable and we will
                    not be liable or responsible for these losses. The user
                    takes full responsibility for these transactions and the
                    accuracy of information.

                  <p>
                    The Blockchain that powers our Platform might be subject to
                    sudden changes in operating rules. Forking the Blockchain
                    might result in multiple versions, and subsequently, in more
                    than one version of your Collectible. This might affect the
                    value and the function of the initial Collectible. Under
                    such a situation, we might temporarily suspend our services
                    while we determine which network to support. The decision
                    will be at our sole and absolute discretion. We also reserve
                    the right to stop supporting/abandoning the initial or the
                    copy of the Collectible. We, at our sole discretion, might
                    obtain and retain the unsupported Collectible.

                    valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by the
                    Applicable Law. If any clause of those Terms is asserted
                    invalid, unlawful or unenforceable via way of means of any
                    in a position court, tribunal, arbitral bench, or any any

                    will be deemed a provision of those Terms as though at the
                    beginning included and shall carry the same commercial
                    effect/interest as the term it replaces/adjusts. If the
                    availability invalidated is of the sort of nature that it
                    can not be so adjusted, the availability will be deemed
                    deleted from the Terms as even though the availability had
                    by no means been included.

                  <h4>Arbitration</h4>
                  <p>
                    All disputes arising out of or in connection with the
                    present terms or in reference to or at once or not directly
                    regarding those Terms or any of the topics or transactions
                    pondered with the aid of using those Terms (for the
                    avoidance of doubt, along with any declare searching for to
                    invalidate, or alleging that, any or all a part of those
                    Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable) (such claims,
                    disputes and controversies, collectively, “Disputes”) and
                    not resolved after 60 days of negotiations since the rise of
                    such dispute, will be eventually settled with the aid of
                    using binding arbitration. The arbitrator shall have
                    distinctive authority to clear up all Disputes, and the
                    arbitral award will be very last and binding upon the
                    parties. The Arbitration shall take place in English. The
                    seat of Arbitration shall be Singapore. The venue of the
                    arbitral proceedings can be online or determined as per
                    convenience of the parties. All Users hereby agree that any
                    arbitration or claim shall be undertaken in their individual
                    capacity and not as a joint class action.

                    JUMP.TRADE Company or any User may also provoke an
                    arbitration intending through turning in written notice to
                    the other, whereupon the parties shall fairly cooperate to
                    pick out an arbitrator and submit the Dispute to such
                    arbitrator. In the event the parties are not able to agree
                    on the choice of an arbitrator within 15 days from the
                    submitting of a call for arbitration, the Singapore
                    Arbitration Association (the “SAA”) shall appoint the
                    arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award will be written and
                    reasoned, and binding on the parties in any and all
                    jurisdictions.

                  <p>
                    The parties agree that the arbitral process shall be
                    conducted in confidentiality and disclosure of any
                    information about the arbitrator proceedings or information
                    learned during the proceedings could be detrimental to the

                    liable to further damages if there is any breach of such
                    Confidentiality and unauthorized disclosure of confidential
                    information.
