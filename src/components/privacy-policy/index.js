                      Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data” means data that
                      allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for
                      example, your name, telephone number, e-mail address, as

                      associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.
                      “Anonymous Data” means data, including aggregated and
                      de-identified data, that is not associated with or linked
                      to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself,
                      permit the identification of individual persons. We
                      collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described

                              Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our
                              Service more useful to you, our servers (which may
                              be hosted by a third-party service provider)
                              collect information from you, including your
                              browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol
                              (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically
                              assigned to your computer when you use the
                              Internet, which may vary from session to session),

                              Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather
                              certain information automatically and store it in
                              log files. This information includes IP addresses,
                              browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”),
                              referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
                              stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
                              information to analyze trends, administer the
                              Service, track users’ movements around the
                              Service, gather demographic information about our
                              user base as a whole, and better tailor our
                              Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of
                              the information may be collected so that when you
                              visit the Service, it will recognize you and the
                              information could then be used to serve
                              advertisements and other information appropriate
                              to your interests.

                              Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies
                              to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces
                              of information that a website sends to your
                              computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the
                              website. We may use both session Cookies (which
                              expire once you close your web browser) and
                              persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer
                              until you delete them or until a specified
                              duration - whichever is earlier) to provide you
                              with a more personal and interactive experience on
                              our Service. This type of information is collected
                              to make the Service more useful to you and to
                              tailor the experience with us to meet your special
                              interests and needs.

                              Pixel Tag. In addition, we may use “Pixel Tags”
                              (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or
                              Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with
                              a unique identifier, similar in function to
                              Cookies, that are used to track online movements
                              of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are
                              stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags
                              are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags
                              also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format
                              users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails
                              have been opened to ensure that we are sending
                              only messages that are of interest to our users.
                              We may use this information to reduce or eliminate
                              messages sent to a user. We do not tie the
                              information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’
                              Personal Data.

                              other mechanisms that might enable Users to

                              technologies we place, other companies may set
                              their own cookies or similar tools when you visit
                              our Service. This includes third-party analytics
                              services, including but not limited to Google
                              Analytics (“Analytics Services”), that we engage
                              to help analyze how users use the Service. We may
                              receive reports based on these parties’ use of
                              these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.
                              We use the information we get from Analytics
                              Services only to improve our Service. The
                              information generated by the Cookies or other
                              technologies about your use of our Service (the
                              “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the
                              Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use
                              Analytics Information to compile reports on user
                              activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer
                              information to third parties where required to do
                              so by law, or where such third parties process
                              Analytics Information on their behalf. Each
                              Analytics Services’ ability to use and share
                              Analytics Information is restricted by such
